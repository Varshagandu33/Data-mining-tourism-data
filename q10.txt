From results of q1 is mentioned below, we can see that in the Monthwise Yearly Change, Percentage table the months starting from march have seen the worst drop in incoming tourists in year 2020 and improved in late 2021. By seeing the changes in years of 2020, 2021 we can say that the Incoming Tourists have significantly decreased to India.

From results of q2 (by fee), we can observe
For year 2020 maximum tourists are observed in  Jan
For year 2020 minimum tourists are observed in  Apr
For year 2021 minimum tourists are observed in  May
For year 2021 maximum tourists are observed in  Dec

So we can see that from the fee collection perspective, the time from Mar 2020 to May 2021 was very low in terms of income from Incoming Tourists which is basically the COVID time.


From q4 results (outgoing), we can observe that
Max Positive Change is seen in 2021-22
Max Negative Change is seen in 2019-20
Max Change is seen in months of Jan-Feb for the year 2020
Min Change is seen in months of Mar-Apr for the year 2020
Min Change is seen in months of May-Jun for the year 2021
Max Change is seen in months of Jan-Feb for the year 2021

So this too, following the same trends with above conclusions tells that the time between Mar 2020 to May 2021 has seen low Outgoing Tourists from India which was an effect of COVID.
